USER AUTHENTICATIOR

This project is to demonstrate how passwords are getting stored in the database when the user account is created. and developer or we make sure that the passwords of the user are not to get compromised or stolen.
to increase the possibility to not to get stolen we are gonna hash the password before the password is getting stored. and this hashed password will be stored in the DB. And if the account already exist and the user wants to login then the entered password by the user will get hashed and compares with stored hash from the DB.
